## Introduction

Visformer, or Vision-friendly Transformer, is an architecture that combines Transformer-based architectural features with those from convolutional neural network architectures. Visformer adopts the stage-wise design for higher base performance. But self-attentions are only utilized in the last two stages, considering that self-attention in the high-resolution stage is relatively inefficient even when the FLOPs are balanced. Visformer employs bottleneck blocks in the first stage and utilizes group 3 Ã— 3 convolutions in bottleneck blocks inspired by ResNeXt. It also introduces BatchNorm to patch embedding modules as in CNNs. [[2](#references)]

#### Notes
- Context: Training context denoted as {device}x{pieces}-{MS mode}, where mindspore mode can be G - graph mode or F - pynative mode with ms function. For example, D910x8-G is for training on 8 pieces of Ascend 910 NPU using graph mode.
- Top-1 and Top-5: Accuracy reported on the validation set of ImageNet-1K.

## Quick Start
### Preparation

#### Installation
Please refer to the [installation instruction](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindcv#installation) in MindCV.

#### Dataset Preparation
Please download the [ImageNet-1K](https://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/index.php) dataset for model training and validation.

### Training

* Distributed Training

It is easy to reproduce the reported results with the pre-defined training recipe. For distributed training on multiple Ascend 910 devices, please run

```shell
# distributed training on multiple GPU/Ascend devices
mpirun -n 8 python train.py --config configs/visformer/visformer_tiny_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/imagenet
```

Similarly, you can train the model on multiple GPU devices with the above `mpirun` command.

For detailed illustration of all hyper-parameters, please refer to [config.py](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindcv/blob/main/config.py).

**Note:**  As the global batch size  (batch_size x num_devices) is an important hyper-parameter, it is recommended to keep the global batch size unchanged for reproduction or adjust the learning rate linearly to a new global batch size.

* Standalone Training

If you want to train or finetune the model on a smaller dataset without distributed training, please run:

```shell
# standalone training on a CPU/GPU/Ascend device
python train.py --config configs/visformer/visformer_tiny_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/dataset --distribute False
```

### Validation

To validate the accuracy of the trained model, you can use `validate.py` and parse the checkpoint path with `--ckpt_path`.

```
python validate.py -c configs/visformer/visformer_tiny_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/imagenet --ckpt_path /path/to/ckpt
```

### Deployment

To deploy online inference services with the trained model efficiently, please refer to the [deployment tutorial](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindcv/blob/main/tutorials/deployment.md).
