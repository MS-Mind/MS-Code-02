## Introduction
<!--- Guideline: Introduce the model and architectures. Cite if you use/adopt paper explanation from others. -->

High-resolution representations are essential for position-sensitive vision problems, such as human pose estimation, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Existing state-of-the-art frameworks first encode the input image as a low-resolution representation through a subnetwork that is formed by connecting high-to-low resolution convolutions (e.g., ResNet, VGGNet), and then recover the high-resolution representation from the encoded low-resolution representation. Instead, the proposed network, named as High-Resolution Network (HRNet), maintains high-resolution representations through the whole process. There are two key characteristics: (i) Connect the high-to-low resolution convolution streams in parallel; (ii) Repeatedly exchange the information across resolutions. The benefit is that the resulting representation is semantically richer and spatially more precise. It shows the superiority of the proposed HRNet in a wide range of applications, including human pose estimation, semantic segmentation, and object detection, suggesting that the HRNet is a stronger backbone for computer vision problems.

#### Notes
- Context: Training context denoted as {device}x{pieces}-{MS mode}, where mindspore mode can be G - graph mode or F - pynative mode with ms function. For example, D910x8-G is for training on 8 pieces of Ascend 910 NPU using graph mode.
- Top-1 and Top-5: Accuracy reported on the validation set of ImageNet-1K.


## Quick Start
### Preparation

#### Installation
Please refer to the [installation instruction](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindcv#installation) in MindCV.

#### Dataset Preparation
Please download the [ImageNet-1K](https://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/index.php) dataset for model training and validation.

### Training
<!--- Guideline: Avoid using shell script in the command line. Python script preferred. -->

* Distributed Training

It is easy to reproduce the reported results with the pre-defined training recipe. For distributed training on multiple Ascend 910 devices, please run

```shell
# distributed training on multiple GPU/Ascend devices
mpirun -n 8 python train.py --config configs/hrnet/hrnet_w32_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/imagenet
```
> If the script is executed by the root user, the `--allow-run-as-root` parameter must be added to `mpirun`.

Similarly, you can train the model on multiple GPU devices with the above `mpirun` command.

For detailed illustration of all hyper-parameters, please refer to [config.py](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindcv/blob/main/config.py).

**Note:**  As the global batch size  (batch_size x num_devices) is an important hyper-parameter, it is recommended to keep the global batch size unchanged for reproduction or adjust the learning rate linearly to a new global batch size.

* Standalone Training

If you want to train or finetune the model on a smaller dataset without distributed training, please run:

```shell
# standalone training on a CPU/GPU/Ascend device
python train.py --config configs/hrnet/hrnet_w32_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/dataset --distribute False
```

### Validation

To validate the accuracy of the trained model, you can use `validate.py` and parse the checkpoint path with `--ckpt_path`.

```
python validate.py -c configs/hrnet/hrnet_w32_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/imagenet --ckpt_path /path/to/ckpt
```

### Deployment

To deploy online inference services with the trained model efficiently, please refer to the [deployment tutorial](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindcv/blob/main/tutorials/deployment.md).
