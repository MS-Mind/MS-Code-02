## Introduction
<!--- Guideline: Introduce the model and architectures. Cite if you use/adopt paper explanation from others. -->

Vision Transformer (ViT) achieves remarkable results compared to convolutional neural networks (CNN) while obtaining fewer computational resources for pre-training. In comparison to convolutional neural networks (CNN), Vision Transformer (ViT) shows a generally weaker inductive bias resulting in increased reliance on model regularization or data augmentation (AugReg) when training on smaller datasets.

The ViT is a visual model based on the architecture of a transformer originally designed for text-based tasks, as shown in the below figure. The ViT model represents an input image as a series of image patches, like the series of word embeddings used when using transformers to text, and directly predicts class labels for the image. ViT exhibits an extraordinary performance when trained on enough data, breaking the performance of a similar state-of-art CNN with 4x fewer computational resources. [[2](#references)]

Table Format:
- Model: model name in lower case with _ seperator.
- Context: Training context denoted as {device}x{pieces}-{MS mode}, where mindspore mode can be G - graph mode or F - pynative mode with ms function. For example, D910x8-G is for training on 8 pieces of Ascend 910 NPU using graph mode.
- Top-1 and Top-5: Keep 2 digits after the decimal point.
- Params (M): # of model parameters in millions (10^6). Keep 2 digits after the decimal point
- Recipe: Training recipe/configuration linked to a yaml config file. Use absolute url path.
- Download: url of the pretrained model weights. Use absolute url path.

- Top-1 and Top-5: Accuracy reported on the validation set of ImageNet-1K.


## Quick Start
### Preparation

#### Installation
Please refer to the [installation instruction](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindcv#installation) in MindCV.

#### Dataset Preparation
Please download the [ImageNet-1K](https://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/index.php) dataset for model training and validation.

### Training
<!--- Guideline: Avoid using shell script in the command line. Python script preferred. -->

* Distributed Training

It is easy to reproduce the reported results with the pre-defined training recipe. For distributed training on multiple Ascend 910 devices, please run

```shell
# distributed training on multiple GPU/Ascend devices
mpirun -n 8 python train.py --config configs/vit/vit_b32_224_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/imagenet
```
> If the script is executed by the root user, the `--allow-run-as-root` parameter must be added to `mpirun`.

Similarly, you can train the model on multiple GPU devices with the above `mpirun` command.

For detailed illustration of all hyper-parameters, please refer to [config.py](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindcv/blob/main/config.py).

**Note:**  As the global batch size  (batch_size x num_devices) is an important hyper-parameter, it is recommended to keep the global batch size unchanged for reproduction or adjust the learning rate linearly to a new global batch size.

* Standalone Training

If you want to train or finetune the model on a smaller dataset without distributed training, please run:

```shell
# standalone training on a CPU/GPU/Ascend device
python train.py --config configs/vit/vit_b32_224_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/dataset --distribute False
```

### Validation

To validate the accuracy of the trained model, you can use `validate.py` and parse the checkpoint path with `--ckpt_path`.

```
python validate.py -c configs/vit/vit_b32_224_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/imagenet --ckpt_path /path/to/ckpt
```

### Deployment

To deploy online inference services with the trained model efficiently, please refer to the [deployment tutorial](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindcv/blob/main/tutorials/deployment.md).
