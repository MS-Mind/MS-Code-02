## Introduction

InceptionV3 is an upgraded version of GoogleNet. One of the most important improvements of V3 is Factorization, which
decomposes 7x7 into two one-dimensional convolutions (1x7, 7x1), and 3x3 is the same (1x3, 3x1), such benefits, both It
can accelerate the calculation (excess computing power can be used to deepen the network), and can split 1 conv into 2
convs, which further increases the network depth and increases the nonlinearity of the network. It is also worth noting
that the network input from 224x224 has become 299x299, and 35x35/17x17/8x8 modules are designed more precisely. In
addition, V3 also adds batch normalization, which makes the model converge more quickly, which plays a role in partial
regularization and effectively reduces overfitting.[[1](#references)]

## Results

Our reproduced model performance on ImageNet-1K is reported as follows.

#### Notes

- Context: Training context denoted as {device}x{pieces}-{MS mode}, where mindspore mode can be G - graph mode or F - pynative mode with ms function. For example, D910x8-G is for training on 8 pieces of Ascend 910 NPU using graph mode.
- Top-1 and Top-5: Accuracy reported on the validation set of ImageNet-1K.

## Quick Start

### Preparation

#### Installation
Please refer to the [installation instruction](https://github.com/mindspore-ecosystem/mindcv#installation) in MindCV.

#### Dataset Preparation
Please download the [ImageNet-1K](https://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/index.php) dataset for model training and validation.

### Training

* Distributed Training

It is easy to reproduce the reported results with the pre-defined training recipe. For distributed training on multiple Ascend 910 devices, please run

```shell
# distributed training on multiple GPU/Ascend devices
mpirun -n 8 python train.py --config configs/inception_v3/inception_v3_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/imagenet
```

> If the script is executed by the root user, the `--allow-run-as-root` parameter must be added to `mpirun`.

Similarly, you can train the model on multiple GPU devices with the above `mpirun` command.

For detailed illustration of all hyper-parameters, please refer to [config.py](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindcv/blob/main/config.py).

**Note:**  As the global batch size  (batch_size x num_devices) is an important hyper-parameter, it is recommended to keep the global batch size unchanged for reproduction or adjust the learning rate linearly to a new global batch size.

* Standalone Training

If you want to train or finetune the model on a smaller dataset without distributed training, please run:

```shell
# standalone training on a CPU/GPU/Ascend device
python train.py --config configs/inception_v3/inception_v3_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/dataset --distribute False
```

### Validation

To validate the accuracy of the trained model, you can use `validate.py` and parse the checkpoint path with `--ckpt_path`.

```shell
python validate.py -c configs/inception_v3/inception_v3_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/imagenet --ckpt_path /path/to/ckpt
```

### Deployment

Please refer to the [deployment tutorial](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindcv/blob/main/tutorials/deployment.md) in MindCV.
