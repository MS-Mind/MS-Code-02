## Introduction

Compared to convolutional layers, fully-connected (FC) layers are better at modeling the long-range dependencies
but worse at capturing the local patterns, hence usually less favored for image recognition. In this paper, the authors propose a
methodology, Locality Injection, to incorporate local priors into an FC layer via merging the trained parameters of a
parallel conv kernel into the FC kernel. Locality Injection can be viewed as a novel Structural Re-parameterization
method since it equivalently converts the structures via transforming the parameters. Based on that, the authors propose a
multi-layer-perceptron (MLP) block named RepMLP Block, which uses three FC layers to extract features, and a novel
architecture named RepMLPNet. The hierarchical design distinguishes RepMLPNet from the other concurrently proposed vision MLPs.
As it produces feature maps of different levels, it qualifies as a backbone model for downstream tasks like semantic segmentation.
Their results reveal that 1) Locality Injection is a general methodology for MLP models; 2) RepMLPNet has favorable accuracy-efficiency
trade-off compared to the other MLPs; 3) RepMLPNet is the first MLP that seamlessly transfer to Cityscapes semantic segmentation.

#### Notes

- Context: Training context denoted as {device}x{pieces}-{MS mode}, where mindspore mode can be G - graph mode or F - pynative mode with ms function. For example, D910x8-G is for training on 8 pieces of Ascend 910 NPU using graph mode.
- Top-1 and Top-5: Accuracy reported on the validation set of ImageNet-1K.

## Quick Start

### Preparation

#### Installation

Please refer to the [installation instruction](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindcv#installation) in MindCV.

#### Dataset Preparation

Please download the [ImageNet-1K](https://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/index.php) dataset for model training and validation.

### Training

- Distributed Training

It is easy to reproduce the reported results with the pre-defined training recipe. For distributed training on multiple Ascend 910 devices, please run

```shell
# distributed training on multiple GPU/Ascend devices
mpirun -n 8 python train.py --config configs/repmlp/repmlp_t224_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/imagenet
```
> If the script is executed by the root user, the `--allow-run-as-root` parameter must be added to `mpirun`.

Similarly, you can train the model on multiple GPU devices with the above `mpirun` command.

For detailed illustration of all hyper-parameters, please refer to [config.py](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindcv/blob/main/config.py).

**Note:** As the global batch size (batch_size x num_devices) is an important hyper-parameter, it is recommended to keep the global batch size unchanged for reproduction or adjust the learning rate linearly to a new global batch size.

* Standalone Training

If you want to train or finetune the model on a smaller dataset without distributed training, please run:

```shell
# standalone training on a CPU/GPU/Ascend device
python train.py --config configs/repmlp/repmlp_t224_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/imagenet --distribute False
```

### Validation

To validate the accuracy of the trained model, you can use `validate.py` and parse the checkpoint path with `--ckpt_path`.

```shell
python validate.py --model=RepMLPNet_T224 --data_dir /path/to/imagenet --ckpt_path /path/to/ckpt
```

### Deployment

To deploy online inference services with the trained model efficiently, please refer to the [deployment tutorial](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindcv/blob/main/tutorials/deployment.md).
