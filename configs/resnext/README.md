> [Aggregated Residual Transformations for Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05431)

## Introduction

The authors present a simple, highly modularized network architecture for image classification. The network is
constructed by repeating a building block that aggregates a set of transformations with the same topology. The simple
design results in a homogeneous, multi-branch architecture that has only a few hyper-parameters to set. This strategy
exposes a new dimension, which the authors call "cardinality" (the size of the set of transformations), as an essential
factor in addition to the dimensions of depth and width. On the ImageNet-1K dataset, the authors empirically show that
even under the restricted condition of maintaining complexity, increasing cardinality is able to improve classification
accuracy.[[1](#references)]

#### Notes

- Context: Training context denoted as {device}x{pieces}-{MS mode}, where mindspore mode can be G - graph mode or F - pynative mode with ms function. For example, D910x8-G is for training on 8 pieces of Ascend 910 NPU using graph mode.
- Top-1 and Top-5: Accuracy reported on the validation set of ImageNet-1K.

## Quick Start

### Preparation

#### Installation
Please refer to the [installation instruction](https://github.com/mindspore-ecosystem/mindcv#installation) in MindCV.

#### Dataset Preparation
Please download the [ImageNet-1K](https://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/index.php) dataset for model training and validation.

### Training

* Distributed Training

It is easy to reproduce the reported results with the pre-defined training recipe. For distributed training on multiple Ascend 910 devices, please run

```shell
# distributed training on multiple GPU/Ascend devices
mpirun -n 8 python train.py --config configs/resnext/resnext50_32x4d_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/imagenet
```

> If the script is executed by the root user, the `--allow-run-as-root` parameter must be added to `mpirun`.

Similarly, you can train the model on multiple GPU devices with the above `mpirun` command.

For detailed illustration of all hyper-parameters, please refer to [config.py](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindcv/blob/main/config.py).

**Note:**  As the global batch size  (batch_size x num_devices) is an important hyper-parameter, it is recommended to keep the global batch size unchanged for reproduction or adjust the learning rate linearly to a new global batch size.

* Standalone Training

If you want to train or finetune the model on a smaller dataset without distributed training, please run:

```shell
# standalone training on a CPU/GPU/Ascend device
python train.py --config configs/resnext/resnext50_32x4d_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/dataset --distribute False
```

### Validation

To validate the accuracy of the trained model, you can use `validate.py` and parse the checkpoint path with `--ckpt_path`.

```shell
python validate.py -c configs/resnext/resnext50_32x4d_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/imagenet --ckpt_path /path/to/ckpt
```

### Deployment

Please refer to the [deployment tutorial](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindcv/blob/main/tutorials/deployment.md) in MindCV.
